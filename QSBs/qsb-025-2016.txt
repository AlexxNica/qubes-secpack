            Xen bug in event channel handling code (XSA 188)


Quick Summary
==============

The Xen Security Team has announced a security bug (XSA 188)
in the hypervisor FIFO event channel handling code[1]:

| When the EVTCHNOP_init_control operation is called with a bad guest
| frame number, it takes an error path which frees a control structure
| without also clearing the corresponding pointer.  Certain subsequent
| operations (EVTCHNOP_expand_array or another EVTCHNOP_init_control),
| upon finding the non-NULL pointer, continue operation assuming it
| points to allocated memory.

| A malicious guest administrator can crash the host, leading to a DoS.
| Arbitrary code execution (and therefore privilege escalation), and
| information leaks, cannot be excluded.

Only the Xen version used in Qubes 3.0 is affected. Qubes 3.1 and
newer are not affected by this bug.

Announcement time and EOL of Qubes 3.0
======================================

The bug has been announced a day before end of life for Qubes 3.0[2].
Because of this we have decided to not write detailed analysis, but
still release updated packages.

This is the last security fix released for Qubes 3.0. We recommend to
upgrade all systems to newer (still supported) version.

Patching
=========

The specific packages that resolve the problem discussed in this
bulletin have been uploaded to the security-testing repository:

For Qubes R3.0:
 - Multiple Xen packages, version 4.4.3-13

The packages can be installed in dom0 via the qubes-dom0-update command
or via the Qubes VM Manager.
