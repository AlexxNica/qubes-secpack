Problem description
---------------------

Over the last weeks, Xen.org has announced a bunch of security
advisories (XSA 44-51 [1]) affecting the Xen hypervisor, some of which
apply to Qubes OS Release 1 and Release 2 as well.

The impact of those bugs appears to be limited to DoS attacks only,
however. Nevertheless, a bug is a bug, and all the users are encouraged
to patch.

Patching
----------

We have uploaded the patched Xen packages for Qubes Release 1 (version
4.1.2-9), as well as for the latest Qubes R2 Beta 2 (version 4.1.2-27).
In order to update your system, either click on the "Upload"
button in the Qubes Manager after selecting Dom0, or use the following
command-line command:

sudo qubes-dom0-updates

A system restart will be required afterwards.

If you use Anti Evil Maid, you will need to reseal your secret
passphrase to new PCR values, as PCR14 will change because of a new
xen.gz binary.


Discussion
------------

Out of the bugs mentioned above, the one described in XSA 50 [2] seems
to be having some potential for more than just a DoS. Xen.org in the
advisory wrote this:

"A malicious guest administrator can cause undefined behaviour;
depending on the dom0 kernel a host crash is possible, but information
leakage or privilege escalation cannot be ruled out."

The Qubes Security Team is not aware of any successful exploitation
approach of this bug on Qubes OS, whether reliable or not, but we have
not investigated this issue more thoroughly.
