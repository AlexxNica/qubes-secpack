   Xen Hypervisor Information Leaks Vulnerabilities (XSA 121 & 122)


Quick Summary
==============

These two bugs are in the upstream Xen (see [1] and [2] for original
announcements). Below is the description provided by the Xen Security
Team:

| Xen Security Advisory CVE-2015-2044 / XSA-121
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Emulation routines in the hypervisor dealing with certain system
| devices check whether the access size by the guest is a supported one.
| When the access size is unsupported these routines failed to set the
| data to be returned to the guest for read accesses, so that hypervisor
| stack contents are copied into the destination of the operation, thus
| becoming visible to the guest.
|

| Xen Security Advisory CVE-2015-2045 / XSA-122
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
| The code handling certain sub-operations of the HYPERVISOR_xen_version
| hypercall fails to fully initialize all fields of structures
| subsequently copied back to guest memory. Due to this hypervisor stack
| contents are copied into the destination of the operation, thus
| becoming visible to the guest.
| 

In other words, the bug allows a malicious HVM guest to read some
contents of the hypervisor memory (stack).

Discussion
===========

The practical impact of this bug seems to be similar to that offered
by the XSA108, discussed in the Qubes Security Bulletin #12 [3]. In
other words, we believe the practical impact is minor, due to lack of
security sensitive data present on the Xen stack.

Patching
=========

The specific packages that resolve the problem discussed in this
bulletin (and also brining a few other reliability patches to Xen)
have been uploaded to the security-testing repository:

* xen packages, version 4.1.6.1-20

The packages are to be installed in Dom0 via qubes-dom0-update command
or via the Qubes graphical manager.

A system restart will be required afterwards.

If you use Anti Evil Maid, you will need to reseal your secret
passphrase to new PCR values, as PCR14 will change because of a new
xen.gz binary.

These packages will be moved to the current repository over the coming
days once they receive more testing from the community.

About Qubes Security Testing Repository
----------------------------------------

The security-testing is a new Qubes package repository that has been
introduced recently. It is disabled by default, and its purpose is to
allow better and wider testing of security critical updates, before
they make it to the "current" (default) repository.

This allows the users (rather than Qubes developers) to make the
tradeoffs of whether to install security updates early vs. wait until
they get more tested by the community. This accounts for the fact that
Qubes developers have limited ability to perform thorough testing
themselves. To help with the process we provide detailed analysis of
the security problems addressed by each QSB.

The security-testing repo definition is provided by the latest
core-agent-linux package (version 2.1.49) for the VMs, and
qubes-release-2-11 for Dom0. These packages are already available in
the default current repository.
