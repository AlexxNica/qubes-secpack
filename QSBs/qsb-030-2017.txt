 Critical Xen bugs related to PV memory virtualization (XSA-213, XSA-214)


Quick Summary
==============

Today the Xen Security Team has disclosed two bugs related to PV
memory handling affecting Qubes OS:

Xen Security Advisory XSA-213[1]:

|   x86: 64bit PV guest breakout via pagetable use-after-mode-change
|
| 64-bit PV guests typically use separate (root) page tables for their
| kernel and user modes.  Hypercalls are accessible to guest kernel
| context only, which certain hypercall handlers make assumptions on.
| The IRET hypercall (replacing the identically name CPU instruction)
| is used by guest kernels to transfer control from kernel mode to user
| mode.  If such an IRET hypercall is placed in the middle of a multicall
| batch, subsequent operations invoked by the same multicall batch may
| wrongly assume the guest to still be in kernel mode.  If one or more of
| these subsequent operations involve operations on page tables, they may
| be using the wrong root page table, confusing internal accounting.  As
| a result the guest may gain writable access to some of its page tables.


Xen Security Advisory XSA-214[2]:

|          grant transfer allows PV guest to elevate privileges
| 
| The GNTTABOP_transfer operation allows one guest to transfer a page to
| another guest.  The internal processing of this, however, does not
| include zapping the previous type of the page being transferred.  This
| makes it possible for a PV guest to transfer a page previously used as
| part of a segment descriptor table to another guest while retaining the
| "contains segment descriptors" property.
| 
| If the destination guest is a PV one of different bitness, it may gain
| access to segment descriptors it is not normally allowed to have, like
| 64-bit code segments in a 32-bit PV guest.
| 
| If the destination guest is a HVM one, that guest may freely alter the
| page contents and then hand the page back to the same or another PV
| guest.
| 
| In either case, if the destination PV guest then inserts that page into
| one of its own descriptor tables, the page still having the designated
| type results in validation of its contents being skipped.


An attacker who exploits any of those bugs can break Qubes-provided
isolation.  This means that if an attacker has already exploited
another vulnerability, e.g. in a Web browser or networking or USB
stack, then the attacker would be able to compromise a whole Qubes
system.

The second bug require cooperation of two VMs of different type, which
somehow limits is applicability.

The Xen Security Team have also announced a third advisory today:
XSA-215 "possible memory corruption via failsafe callback"[3]. We
believe its impact is limited to the hardware beyond of scope of Qubes
OS:

| Only x86 systems with physical memory extending to a configuration
| dependent boundary (5Tb or 3.5Tb) may be affected.  Whether they are
| actually affected depends on actual physical memory layout.


Availability of patches
========================

Patched packages will be built and uploaded to the security-testing
repository shortly after this advisory is published. We have recently
implemented and published the details of a new, transparent build
infrastructure. [4] In this new infrastructure, the source code for
packages is pushed to a public repository, and logs from the build
process are also publicly published. However, the Xen security policy
does not permit us to make this data public until after the embargo
has been lifted. [5] While we have already privately built and tested
these packages, we must wait until the embargo has been lifted before
transparently building the public packages using our new
infrastructure.

Patching
=========

The specific packages that resolve the problem discussed in this
bulletin will be uploaded to the security-testing repository:

For Qubes 3.2:
* Xen packages, version 4.6.4-27

The packages are to be installed in Dom0 via the qubes-dom0-update
command or via the Qubes VM Manager.

A system restart will be required afterwards.

If you use Anti Evil Maid, you will need to reseal your secret
passphrase to new PCR values, as PCR18 will change due to the new
xen.gz binary.

These packages will migrate to the current (stable) repository over
the coming days after being tested by the community.
