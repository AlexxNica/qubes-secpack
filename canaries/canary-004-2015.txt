Statements
-----------

The Qubes core developers who undersigned this file [1] state the
following:

1. The date of issue of this canary is August 5, 2015.

2. There have been 21 Qubes Security Bulletins published so far.

3. Qubes Master Signing Key fingerprint is:

427F 11FD 0FAA 4B08 0123  F01C DDFA 1A3E 3687 9494

4. No warrants have ever been served to them with regards to the Qubes
OS Project (e.g. to hand out the private signing keys, or to introduce
backdoors).

5. The next such canary statement is planned to be published in the
first 2 weeks of October 2015. Special note should be taken if no new
canary gets published by that time, or if the list of statements
change without plausible explanation.

Special announcements
----------------------

* We have opened a Twitter news channel for the project: @QubesOS

* We would like to remind that Qubes OS has been designed with the
assumption of all the infrastructure being permanently compromised.
This means we don't assume trust in neither our updates-serving
servers, source code repositories-hosting servers or services, nor the
servers offering Qubes ISO downloads.

* The only reliable way to verify downloaded Qubes ISOs, updates,
source code, or any other resources related to Qubes, is by verifying
digital signatures on the files or on the git tags. The HTTPS
connection to any of our servers is NOT considered a reliable way to
prove anything about the integrity of the resources accessed.

* That being said, given the growing interest in Qubes OS from the
less technical audience in the recent months, we have undertaken some
efforts to transition to a slightly more trustworthy infrastructure
for our ISO-serving servers. The two official servers for Qubes
installation ISOs are now: 1) mirror.kernel.org, generously provided
by the Linux Foundation, and 2) our own ftp.qubes-os.org physically
hosted and managed by a befriended people in the EU.

1. https://ftp.qubes-os.org/iso/
2. https://mirrors.kernel.org/qubes/iso/

Disclaimers & Notes
---------------------

This canary scheme is not infallible. Although signing the declaration
makes it very difficult for a third party to produce arbitrary
declarations, it does not prevent them from using force, or other
means like blackmail, or compromise of the signers' laptops, to coerce
us to produce false declarations.

The news feed quoted below (Proof of freshness) serves to demonstrate
that this canary could not have been created prior to the date stated.
It shows that a series of canaries were not created in advance.

This declaration is merely a best effort and provided without any
guarantees, warranty, and is not legally binding in any way to
anybody. None of the signers should be ever held legally responsible
for any of the statements made here.

Footnotes
----------

[1] This file should be signed in two ways: (1) via detached GPG
signatures by each of the signers, distributed together with this
canary in qubes-secpack.git repo, and (2) via digitial signatures on
the corresponding qubes-secpack.git repo tags.

[2] Don't trust just the contents of this file blindly, go and verify
the digital signatures!
