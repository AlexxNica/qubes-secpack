                    ---===[ Qubes Canary #2 ]===---


Statements
-----------

The Qubes core developers who undersigned this file [1] state the
following:

1. The date of issue of this canary is March 5th, 2015.

2. There have been 16 Qubes Security Bulletins published so far,
including the QSB #16.

3. Qubes Master Signing Key fingerprint is:

427F 11FD 0FAA 4B08 0123  F01C DDFA 1A3E 3687 9494

4. No warrants have ever been served to them with regards to the Qubes
OS Project (e.g. to hand out the private signing keys, or to introduce
backdoors).

5. The next such canary statement is planned to be published in the
first week of June 2015. Special note should be taken if no new
canary gets published by that time, or if the list of statements
change without plausible explanation.

Special announcements
----------------------

* In the recent days we've been in the process of migrating our
infrastructure out of our private servers to public services (Git Hub,
SF.net), as part of a larger plan to decentralize our project,
as well as provide better integrity protection for some additional
resources, such as the Wiki documentation.

* At the same time we would like to remind that Qubes OS has been
designed with the assumption of all the infrastructure being
permanently compromised. This means we don't (and have never been)
assume trust in neither our updates-serving server(s), source code
repositories hosting servers or services, nor the servers offering
Qubes ISO downloads.

* The only reliable way to verify downloaded Qubes ISOs, or any other
resources related to Qubes, is by verifying digital signatures on the
files or on the git tags. The HTTPS to the server is NOT considered a
reliable way to prove anything about the integrity of the resources
accessed.

Disclaimers & Notes
---------------------

This scheme is not infallible. Although signing the declaration makes
it very difficult for a third party to produce arbitrary declarations,
it does not prevent them from using force, or other means like
blackmail, or compromise of the signers' laptops, to coerce us to
produce false declarations.

The news feed quoted below (Proof of Date) serves to demonstrate that
this canary could not have been created prior to the date stated. It
shows that a series of canaries were not created in advance.

This declaration is merely a best effort and provided without any
guarantees, warranty, and is not legally binding in any way to
anybody.  None of the signers should be ever held legally responsible
for any of the statements made here.

Footnotes
----------

[1] This file should be signed in two ways: (1) via detached GPG
signatures by each of the signers, distributed together with this
canary in qubes-secpack.git repo, and (2) via digitial signatures on
the corresponding qubes-secpack.git repo tags.

[2] Don't trust just the contents of this file blindly, go and verify
the digital signatures!
